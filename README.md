About project and feature:-    

This is an amazing adventure experience project packed with exciting features. It
includes functionalities such as login, registration, profile management, and profile 
updates.

On the homepage, you'll find a beautifully designed, fully responsive navbar and an 
incredible slider section that highlights the project's key themes. The slider features 
three sections:

***The first slider showcases mountain adventures.
***The second highlights forest adventures.
***The third focuses on desert adventures.
Each slider includes a "See More" button. Clicking it takes you to the main adventure 
card section, which is organized into three categories: mountain, forest, and desert 
adventures. A category tab allows you to easily explore these options by clicking on 
specific tabs.


The site also features a stunning About section, a well-structured Packages section, and 
an impressive footer design.


In the main section, you'll see adventure cards, each with an "Explore Now" button. If 
youâ€™re not logged in, clicking this button redirects you to the login page. Once logged 
in, you can view detailed card information.


On the card details page, you'll find a "Talk with Expert" button. If clicked between 
10:00 AM and 8:00 PM, it directs you to a Google Meet link for live consultation. 
Otherwise, a modal appears with additional information.


This project has many more features for you to explore. Visit the site to experience them 
all!
